The BaseTokenSale contract should not accept eth, and only accept what a user defines as accepted tokens and their respective amounts.  Also an admin function to withdraw stuck tokens.

Much of the logic of depositERC20 and depositNFT functions are the same, so we should combine them into a single function.  Also the user needs a way to update their deposit, either by changing prices, depositing more tokens, or adding more accepted tokens etc.  If possible add this to the same function.

I like that we break up contract logic into seperate files.  Let's keep with that pattern, but combine both the fee and fiat functionality into a single file I will reference as the FiatFeeOracle.  This means the buyToken function in BaseTokenSale contract will need a way to know if it is a fiat purchase or a token purchase and the fee logic will need to be taken into account in the FiatFeeOracle contract and applied before calling the buyToken function.

The whitelist functionality found in the first contract should be added to the FiatFeeOracle contract as well.

Please output these two contracts
